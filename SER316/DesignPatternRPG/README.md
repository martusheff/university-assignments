# Design Patterns to be Used in this Assignment

1) State Pattern: This is a pattern that tracks the behavior and status of an object as it interacts with other game elements. This game will have a bit of moving parts, so having a method of tracking object states will be necessary.
2) MVC (Model, View, Controller): This is a pattern I am luckily already familiar with and look forward to using for this project. In game objects will conform to some kind of model to maintain consistency for objects, the control will handle the interactions made onto the data and will also communicate the model to the views, and speking of the views -- they will relay information in some sort of observable method.
3) Game Loop: This pattern of implementation keeps the game going and avoids any kind of hard stop that isn't initiated by the game's user explicitely.
